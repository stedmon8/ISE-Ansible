# ISE Ansible, and cloud deployment with Terraform


Ansible and Terraform for the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) 


## Quick Start

Clone this repository to your local lab or sandbox environment :  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/stedmon8/ISE-ansible
```

Navigate to the directory that you downloaded above

Install Python 3.9 (tested with 3.9.5) :  

```bash
sudo apt install python3.9.5
```

Use the latest version of PIP :  

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade pip
```

Use a virtual environment for Python to avoid clutter and misconfigurations:  

```bash
pipenv install --python 3.9
pipenv shell
python --version        # Python 3.9.5+
```

Install the `ciscoisesdk`, `ansible`, and `jmespath` Python packages :  

```bash
pipenv install ciscoisesdk
pipenv install ansible
pipenv install jmespath
```

Install the `cisco.ise` Ansible collection:  

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install cisco.ise
```

Install the `community.general` Ansible collection to take advantage of `json_query` and other filters :  

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
```

To install a specific version of the `cisco.ise` collection, use `:` followed by range identifiers (`*` (latest/default), `!=`, `==`, `>=`, `>`, `<=`, `<`)

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install cisco.ise:==0.0.7
```

To check for upgrades to the `cisco.ise` Ansible collection, use :  

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install cisco.ise --upgrade
```

View the list of installed Ansible modules and versions :  

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection list
```


## Environment

Source the `source_me.sh` file to set the prompt and a few environment variables to ignore some warnings.

```bash
source use_me_first.sh
```


## Run a Playbook

The steps below assume you will be cloning this repository into your directories. If you use them in your own lab then you will need to create a different `hosts.ini` file and update the `secrets.yml` file for your environment.

```bash

1. Change variables in host.ini and secrets.yml files 

2. ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini switch_config.yml  # Configure Radius commands for Cisco Switch


3. ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini EnableOpenAPIS.yml  # Enables APIs for your ISE Server

4. ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini MAIN_ISE_config.yml  # See file for details 

5. Update ad_group_conditions.yml file's "condition_id" for each AD group from step 3

6. ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini MAIN_ISE_config-2.yml  # See File for details 

7. Check ISE Server for correct configuration 

```

## Deploy ISE Server in AWS

```bash

Install Homebrew
```

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
```bash
brew tap hashicorp/tap
```


```bash
brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform
```

```bash
terraform init
```

 Subscribe for ISE 3.1 on the AWS marketplace: http://cs.co/ise-aws

 Find AWS EC2 AMI in CloudFormation template from link above

 Change variables in variables.tf file, be sure to insert AMI ID here and other info 

```bash
sudo terraform apply
```

Wait 30-50 minutes for the ISE Server to Intialize 

SSH into your server

```bash
ssh -i "deployer-key" [your_user_name]@[ISE_Server_Public_IP]
```

## [Cisco DevNet Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/ad4bb2ae-bb67-4d93-9f0d-2a6a04792e2e?diagramType=Topology)

If want a lab environment to try API, Python scripting, or Ansible with ISE, you may use the Cisco DevNet Sandbox [ISE with Ansible Automation](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/ad4bb2ae-bb67-4d93-9f0d-2a6a04792e2e?diagramType=Topology) for free! It is the same sandbox used for the Learning Lab below so you can try this repository or your own projects!


## [ISE APIs, Ansible, and Automation DevNet Learning Lab](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/ise-automation)
